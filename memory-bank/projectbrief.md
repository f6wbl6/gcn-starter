# Project Brief: GCN Starter

## Core Requirements

Implement a basic Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) using PyTorch Geometric.

## Goals

-   Provide a functional GCN model implementation (`main.py`).
-   Include unit tests using `pytest` (`test_gcn.py`).
-   Offer clear documentation (`README.md`) on usage, data generation, and debugging.
-   Ensure code quality through refactoring and formatting (`ruff`).
-   Manage dependencies using `uv`.
-   Implement batch learning capabilities.
-   Provide a prediction method.
-   Establish a Memory Bank for project context persistence.
