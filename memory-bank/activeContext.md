# Active Context: GCN Starter

## Current Focus

-   Initializing the Memory Bank system as requested by the user.
-   Ensuring all core Memory Bank files are created with relevant initial content based on the project's current state.

## Recent Changes

-   **Refactoring `main.py`**:
    -   Removed the `test` method.
    -   Modified the internal `_test_epoch` method to use the `predict` method for calculating accuracy.
    -   Separated epoch-level logic (`_train_epoch`, `_validate_epoch`, `_test_epoch`) from the main `fit` loop.
    -   Added type hints to method signatures.
    -   Moved logging configuration into `if __name__ == '__main__':` block (though this was done via `write_to_file` which overwrote previous changes, need to verify final state).
-   **Refactoring `test_gcn.py`**:
    -   Removed the `test_gcn_test` function as the corresponding method in `main.py` was removed.
    -   Corrected import paths for `DataLoader` to use `torch_geometric.loader`.
-   **Added `.clinerules`**: Configured to run `pytest` and `ruff format` automatically on changes to `main.py` or `test_gcn.py`.
-   **Added `predict` method**: Implemented a `predict` method in the `GCN` class and added a corresponding unit test (`test_gcn_predict`).
-   **Implemented Batch Learning**: Modified `fit`, `_train_epoch`, `_validate_epoch`, `_test_epoch` to handle `DataLoader`.
-   **Dependency Management**: Switched to using `uv` and `requirements.txt`.
-   **Code Formatting**: Applied `ruff format` to `main.py` and `test_gcn.py`.

## Next Steps

-   Create the final core Memory Bank file: `progress.md`.
-   Verify the final state of `main.py` after the `write_to_file` refactoring, ensuring logging config is correctly placed and type hints are present.
-   Confirm all tests pass after the refactoring and Memory Bank initialization.
-   Attempt completion of the "initialize memory bank" task.

## Important Patterns & Preferences

-   Adhere strictly to `.clinerules/overview.md` regarding `uv`, `ruff`, and `pytest`.
-   Use the `predict` method for generating predictions; the separate `test` method is deprecated/removed.
-   Logging should use the `logging` module, not `print`.
-   Code should be well-typed and formatted using `ruff`.
